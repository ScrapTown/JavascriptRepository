## VARIABLES

In JavaScript, there are three types of Variables:

1. const -> Used to define constant values, it cannot be reassigned

const a = 23
a = 34         <-- This will raise an error

2. let -> Used to define variable, can be reassigned

let a = 34
a = 56          <== This can be reassigned without raising any error

3. var -> Same as let, but not used that much for now

var a = 56
a = 78

## SCOPE

In JavaScript, there are 2 types of scopes:

1. Block-Scope - Imagine this like area inside the if,else,for,while block.
2. Function-Scope - Imagine this like area inside the function block.

- const and let variable types are block-scoped,meaning if they are declared inside if,else,for,while block then they will be valid till that scope.

- var type will escape(leak) from if,else,for,while block meaning they will be valid even outside these blocks. Except Function block inside which it will stay valid making it an Function-Scoped.
